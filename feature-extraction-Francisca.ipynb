    "The Fourier Transform is a mathematical technique that decomposes an image into its frequency components, allowing for the analysis of textural patterns. We decided to add Fourier-based features to the radiomics features due to insights from the article [colocar o artigo que li]. The output is a matrix representing the intensity of the frequencies present in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this matrix can have high dimensionality, making it difficult to handle and interpret. To simplify the analysis, we chose to work with only four significant parameters: mean, maximum, minimum, and standard deviation of the magnitude spectrum. If we used the full matrix, the resulting CSV file would exceed 1 GB, making the analysis impractical."
